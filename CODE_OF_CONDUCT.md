# Code of Conduct for all contributors

We aim towards building a positive, happy and open-minded community which welcomes all ideas from people of all walks of life. Everyone's inputs and ideas are equally valuable and instrumental in building better code, software and ultimately better products. This Code of Conduct documents our expectations for all contributors towards this project, whether you're a direct or indirect contirbutor.

## Diversity and Inclusivity

We recognize and emphasize the importance of fostering an open community that welcomes inclusivity and diversity, and are striving towards building a 100% harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, nationality, religion, etc.

## Expected and unacceptable behaviours

Examples of expected behaviours include:

-   Understanding and respecting other peoples' viewpoints
-   Being open to constructive criticism
-   Showing gratitude and empathy towards other members
-   Being encouraging towards online community to build better software

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

-   Sexual harrassment through the use of text, words or any form of media
-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Publishing others' private information, such as addresses, without explicit permission

## How to report and deal with unacceptable behaviour

Any instances of unacceptable behaviour may be reported by reaching out to the team via this email: lynnwbl\@gmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## Consequences for unacceptable behaviour

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face repercussions such as ones listed here:

-   A verbal or emailed warning
-   Temporarily removing the reported person from the online community
-   Permanently removing the reported person from the online community
-   Public announcement of an account of the incident
-   Other enforcements if necessary

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
