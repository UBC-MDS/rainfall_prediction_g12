    "You probably got how to set up primary URL endpoints from the [sampleproject.ipynb](https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2021-22/DSCI_525_web-cloud-comp_students/blob/master/release/milestone4/sampleproject.ipynb) and have them process and return some data. Here we are going to create a new endpoint that accepts a POST request of the features required to run the machine learning model that you trained and saved in last milestone (i.e., a user will post the predictions of the 25 climate model rainfall predictions, i.e., features,  needed to predict with your machine learning model).

    "Once your API (app.py) is working, we're ready to deploy it! For this, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup an EC2 instance. Make sure you add a rule in security groups to accept `All TCP` connections from `Anywhere`. SSH into your EC2 instance from milestone2.\n",
    "2. Make a file `app.py` file in your instance and copy what you developed above in there. \n",
    "\n",
    "    2.1 You can use the Linux editor using ```vi```. More details on vi Editor [here](https://www.guru99.com/the-vi-editor.html). Use your previous learnings, notes, mini videos, etc. You can copy code from your jupyter and paste it into `app.py`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.2 Or else you can make a file in your laptop called app.py and copy it over to your EC2 instance using ```scp```. Eg: ```scp -r -i \"ggeorgeAD.pem\" ~/Desktop/app.py  ubuntu@ec2-xxx.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Download your model from s3 to your EC2 instance. You want to configure your S3 for this. Use your previous learnings, notes, mini videos, etc.\n",
    "4. You should use one of those package managers to install the dependencies of your API, like `flask`, `joblib`, `sklearn`, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.1. (Additional help) you can install the required packages inside your terminal.\n",
    "        - Install conda:\n",
    "            wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "            bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "        - Install packages (there might be others): \n",
    "            conda install flask scikit-learn joblib\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now you're ready to start your service, go ahead and run `flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080`. This will make your service available at your EC2 instance's `Public IPv4 address` on port 8080. Please ensure that you run this from where ```app.py``` and ```model.joblib``` reside.\n",
    "6. You can now access your service by typing your EC2 instances `public IPv4 address` append with `:8080` into a browser, so something like `http://Public IPv4 address:8080`. From step 4, you might notice that flask output saying \"Running on http://XXXX:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\", where XXXX is `Private IPv4 address`, and you want to replace it with the `Public IPv4 address`\n",
    "7. You should use `curl` to send a post request to your service to make sure it's working as expected.\n",
    ">EG: curl -X POST http://your_EC2_ip:8080/predict -d '{\"data\":[1,2,3,4,53,11,22,37,41,53,11,24,31,44,53,11,22,35,42,53,12,23,31,42,53]}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Now, what happens if you exit your connection with the EC2 instance? Can you still reach your service?\n",
    "9. We could use several options to help us persist our server even after we exit our shell session. We'll be using `screen`. `screen` will allow us to create a separate session within which we can run `flask` and won't shut down when we exit the main shell session. Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "12. Feel free to exit your connection with the EC2 instance now and try reaccessing your service with `curl`. You should find that the service has now persisted!\n",
    "13. ***CONGRATULATIONS!!!*** You have successfully got to the end of our milestones. Move to Task 3 and submit it."
